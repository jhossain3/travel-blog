# travel-blog
practise travel blog jannah. 
i'm making a travel page that lets users add and view travel page entries after trips. 
it will combine front end, data bases, forms, javascript, react and mui learning to create a complete app. 
members of our group will then be able to interact with the site from their own devices to add and update blog entries with our group holidays :)


if you want to clone this- you need to run a db
i'm doing this using mongodb in a virtual environment (it runs on localhost:27017)
the db needs a collection called travelblug with 2 collections - posts (that contains post entries- so is dynamic) and a static collection (can only edit in the code)- called authors
