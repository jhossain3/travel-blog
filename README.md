# travel-blog
practise travel blog for sads and jannah 
we're making a travel page that lets users add and view travel page entries after trips
it will combine front end, data bases, forms, javascript, react and mui learning to create a complete app
members of our group will then be able to interact with the site from their own devices to add and update blog entries with our group holidays :)
